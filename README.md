# Password Hash Tool Tutorial

## Introduction

Welcome to the Password Hash Tool tutorial! This simple yet powerful Python application is designed to help you generate SHA-256 hashes for passwords and convert text documents into SHA-256 hashes. The tool is built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and hashlib for cryptographic hash functions.

## Features

1. **Password Hashing:**
   - Enter a password to obtain its SHA-256 hash.

2. **Text Document Conversion:**
   - Convert a text document into SHA-256 hashes.

3. **User-Friendly GUI:**
   - Intuitive menu with buttons for different functionalities.
   - Dark-themed GUI for a sleek appearance.
